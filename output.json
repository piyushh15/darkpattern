Optimised. With 2–3× the speed of the previous generation, and featuring silicon designed in‑house for the best possible performance, we’ve redefined the Raspberry Pi experience. Raspberry Pi 5 is built using the RP1 I/O controller, a package containing silicon designed in-house at Raspberry Pi. USB 3 has more total bandwidth, for much faster transfer speeds. Camera and DSI display connectors are interchangeable, so you can have one of each, or two the same. Raspberry Pi 5 features the Broadcom BCM2712 quad-core Arm Cortex A76 processor @ 2.4GHz, making it up to three times faster than the previous generation. With RAM variants up to 8GB, this is the fastest, smoothest Raspberry Pi experience yet. This addition to Raspberry Pi allows you to connect an M.2 SSD to your Raspberry Pi, giving you speedy data transfer and super-fast boot.Product informationTechnical DetailsBrand‎GenericManufacturer‎GenericModel‎Raspberry Pi 5 8GBPackage Dimensions‎17.3 x 9.19 x 2.69 cm; 59 GramsItem model number‎Raspberry Pi 5 8GBMemory Storage Capacity‎8 GBProcessor Count‎4Mounting Hardware‎2 USB 3.0 Port, 2 USB 2.0 Port, 8GB LPDDR4X SDRAM, Gigabit Ethernet Port, 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless, PCIe expansion connector, 64 bit quad core cortex a76 processor.Number of items‎1Batteries Included‎NoBatteries Required‎NoWireless Type‎Bluetooth, 802.11acTotal USB ports‎4Manufacturer‎GenericItem Weight‎59 gAdditional InformationASINB0CPGPJ3JCDate First Available14 December 2023FeedbackWould you like to tell us about a lower price?

Optimised. With 2–3× the speed of the previous generation, and featuring silicon designed in‑house for the best possible performance, we’ve redefined the Raspberry Pi experience. Raspberry Pi 5 is built using the RP1 I/O controller, a package containing silicon designed in-house at Raspberry Pi. USB 3 has more total bandwidth, for much faster transfer speeds. Camera and DSI display connectors are interchangeable, so you can have one of each, or two the same. Raspberry Pi 5 features the Broadcom BCM2712 quad-core Arm Cortex A76 processor @ 2.4GHz, making it up to three times faster than the previous generation. With RAM variants up to 8GB, this is the fastest, smoothest Raspberry Pi experience yet. This addition to Raspberry Pi allows you to connect an M.2 SSD to your Raspberry Pi, giving you speedy data transfer and super-fast boot.Product informationTechnical DetailsBrand‎GenericManufacturer‎GenericModel‎Raspberry Pi 5 8GBPackage Dimensions‎17.3 x 9.19 x 2.69 cm; 59 GramsItem model number‎Raspberry Pi 5 8GBMemory Storage Capacity‎8 GBProcessor Count‎4Mounting Hardware‎2 USB 3.0 Port, 2 USB 2.0 Port, 8GB LPDDR4X SDRAM, Gigabit Ethernet Port, 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless, PCIe expansion connector, 64 bit quad core cortex a76 processor.Number of items‎1Batteries Included‎NoBatteries Required‎NoWireless Type‎Bluetooth, 802.11acTotal USB ports‎4Manufacturer‎GenericItem Weight‎59 gAdditional InformationASINB0CPGPJ3JCDate First Available14 December 2023FeedbackWould you like to tell us about a lower price?

    "text": "Product descriptionRaspberry Pi 5 The everything computer. Optimised. With 2–3× the speed of the previous generation, and featuring silicon designed in‑house for the best possible performance, we’ve redefined the Raspberry Pi experience. Raspberry Pi 5 is built using the RP1 I/O controller, a package containing silicon designed in-house at Raspberry Pi. USB 3 has more total bandwidth, for much faster transfer speeds. Camera and DSI display connectors are interchangeable, so you can have one of each, or two the same. Raspberry Pi 5 features the Broadcom BCM2712 quad-core Arm Cortex A76 processor @ 2.4GHz, making it up to three times faster than the previous generation. With RAM variants up to 8GB, this is the fastest, smoothest Raspberry Pi experience yet. This addition to Raspberry Pi allows you to connect an M.2 SSD to your Raspberry Pi, giving you speedy data transfer and super-fast boot."

With 2–3× the speed of the previous generation, and featuring silicon designed in‑house for the best possible performance, we’ve redefined the Raspberry Pi experience. Raspberry Pi 5 is built using the RP1 I/O controller, a package containing silicon designed in-house at Raspberry Pi. USB 3 has more total bandwidth, for much faster transfer speeds. Camera and DSI display connectors are interchangeable, so you can have one of each, or two the same.
